    "1. Particle Approach: where we just sum the forces from all the other particles. This is an inefficient algorithm as this scales by $N^2$, where $N$ is the number of particles. A better algorithm may do this via a tree code, which scales as $NlogN$\n",
    "2. Grid Approach: This solves for the potential at all grid points, and then differentiates to solve for the force. To do this in this case, we must solve the Elliptic Poisson PDE ($\\nabla^2\\phi(r_{i,j,k})=4\\pi G\\rho(r_{i,j,k})$). This scales as $N_{grid}$ (the number of grid points)"

    "2. Cloud in cell method: $W(d)=1-d/H$ if $d\\leq H$ and $0$ otherwise. So if our mass is at position $3.2$ then it will be assigned proportionally to the 2 cells that it is closest to. So $0.7m$ gets assigned to $3.5$ and $0.3m$ gets assigned to $2.5$. In 2D we share the mass between 4 cells, and in 4D we share the mass between 8 cells.\n",

    "3. Triangular Shaped Cloud: So now $W(d)=\\frac{3}{4}-(\\frac{d}{H})^2$ for $d\\leq H/2$ etc. etc. Look to lectures for more details, but essentially we're just spreading out the particle mass by taking a triangular shaped cloud. \n",
